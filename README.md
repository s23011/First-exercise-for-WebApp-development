## Overview
This project is a development exercise for a class assignment, with three project options available: ```Health Management System```, ```Library System```, and ```Free```. I chose the Free Project option.

The Free Project must meet the following things:

+ Use PHP and a MySQL database.
+ Include operations for data insertion, updating, and deletion in the database.
+ Use CSS and JavaScript for web page design.

## Description
I created a fictional storeâ€™s official website, which includes sections for store information, product details, a user login interface, and a shopping cart feature.
+ For the store information page, I simply used HTML. 
+ In the product details page, I used JavaScript and PHP to fetch the product list from the server, with information including product name, description, preview image, and price.
+ For the user login interface, I implemented basic registration and login functionality.
+ The shopping cart feature was only partially completed, with functions for ```adding items to the cart```, ```displaying current cart contents```, and ```submitting the cart```.
Features such as ```checkout``` and ```shopping history pages``` were not implemented in the final version.
